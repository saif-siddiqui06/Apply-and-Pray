1. Local LLM model running on your local machine, with it's APIs exposed. Example softwares to achieve it are:
    a. Ollama - https://ollama.com/
    b. llama.cpp - https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
    c. LM Studio - https://lmstudio.ai/ (Recommended)
    d. Jan - https://jan.ai/
2. OR you have a valid OpenAI API Key, and money to spare, and you don't mind spending it.
CHECK THE OPENAI API PIRCES AT THEIR WEBSITE (https://openai.com/api/pricing/).

Note: Select your AI provider.
* "openai" - OpenAI API (GPT models) OR OpenAi-compatible APIs (like Ollama)
* "deepseek" - DeepSeek API (DeepSeek models)
* "gemini" - Google Gemini API (Gemini models)
* For any other models, keep it as "openai" if it is compatible with OpenAI's api.

Note: Leave it empty as "" or "not-needed" if not needed. Else will result in error!

Most LLMs are compatible with openai, so keeping it as "openai-like" will work.

Set `stream_output = True` if you want to stream AI output or `stream_output = False` if not.
